# Growbots coding challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the [Growbots coding challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15cdLKUH_XclOh4gl31439XpvCwcQ1FIVpuu35kMCleo/edit). The challenge is building a simple web app that uses the Twitter API.

## Heroku

The app is deployed to Heroku and can be found [here]().

## Setup

To run the app locally, you'll need to setup your environment.

* Install Python 2.7, virtualenv and git
* Run the commands below

```sh
$ chmod u+x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```

## Running locally

To run locally you'll need to activate the virtualenv.

```sh
$ source env/bin/activate
$ ./manage.py
```
Open [http://localhost:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) on your web browser to run the client.
